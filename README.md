* Learn what it means to become a full-stack engineer! If you’re going to be a well rounded engineer, it’s important you understand what is happening on the server-side. In this course, you'll learn to move back and forth between UI and the back-end through the command line, SSH, nginx, docker containers, server security, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 and more.

This course and others like it are available as part of the [Frontend Masters video subscription.](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-v2/)
